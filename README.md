# Pokemon React w/ SWR

## About

This is a Pokemon web application. At the top we have the Pokemon logo. Right underneath it we have a button that plays and pauses the Pokemon Red/Blue Route 1 music. 

It also displays some pokemon objects provided by the Pokemon API. We fetch the data from the Pokemon API using SWR. The data we display from the Pokemon API include:
- Name
- ID
- Sprite
- Type

There are two components of this web app. 
1. Pokemon: This component renders the data we receive from the Pokemon API. 
2. AudioPlayer: This component renders the button we use to play the Pokemon Red/Blue Route 1 song. 

Ther useRequest hook is used to make requests to the Pokemon API.
